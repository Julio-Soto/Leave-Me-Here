      <h2>Welcome</h2>
      <p>Leave me here is a 'proof of concept' node.js application. The source code contains the backdoor vulnerabilities explained in the pages. Follow the command injection instructions in order to remote control the application. Hopefully, this will help you gain some understanding of node.js security principles.</p>

    <h2>What are Backdoors ?</h2>
    <p>Software Backdoors are intentional security faults left in a system to provide access outside of the normal security model. Typically, these vulnerabilities are only known by the person who planted them. They can be an installed program, a rootkit, or just a few lines of malicious code. These unnofficial methods of gaining access can give the hacker full control of the web application
      and even the host.</p>
    <h2>Should I use one ?</h2>
    <p>There are very few cimcumstances where you will actually need to gain unauthorized access to a system. Like in the case of a client that does not want to pay you or some extreme event. If you are working for someone with no programing experience you may feel tempted at leaving something behind. Generally, it is best to be nice and ethical, and not take advange of circumstances.</p>
    <h2>If I use one, will it burn when IP ?</h2>
    <p> Besides the bad pun, yes you could get in trouble. Depending on the client or the owner of the server. Generally it is not worthwhile to pursue a hacker of the average local website, but If you are not careful and someone finds out that you been forwarding data or snooping around for amusement, they may want to report it to some authority. If the client knows is you, most likely he will try to hack you back or get you back somehow. </p>
